# custom_activation_code

Firstly i have created a random k and k1 values which can’t exceed the value of 0.3 and it is random then i wrote a python code to implement it 


Then there is option where we can generate and add on custom  activation function in kears in this code i have worked on different possibilities which i had commented out please check it once i don’t know whether it is correct or not but this is what i have come up and it can handle the negative values also

when you see the code implementation you can see rest
